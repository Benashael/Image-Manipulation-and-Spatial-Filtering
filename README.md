# Image-Manipulation-and-Spatial-Filtering
Performing image manipulation and spatial filtering using OpenCV and PIL.
## Overview
### Image Manipulation
Image manipulation includes copying, fliping and cropping images and it also includes changing specific image pixels.
### Spatial Filtering
Spatial operations use pixels in a neighborhood to determine the present pixel value. Some applications include filtering and sharpening. They are used in many steps in computer vision, such as segmentation, andare a key building block in Artificial Intelligence algorithms.
## Package Used
1. OpenCV
2. Pillow Library (PIL)
## Execution
The execution of this model can be done on both Jupyter notebook and Google Colab.
